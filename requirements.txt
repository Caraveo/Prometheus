# Note: pytorch3d and kaolin are complex dependencies that may require special installation
# They are needed for full MaterialAnything functionality but are optional
# Note: shap-e must be installed from GitHub (see setup.sh)

# NeRF dependencies (optional - TensorFlow 1.15 may not work on Apple Silicon)
# tensorflow==1.15  # Very old, may not work on modern systems
# configargparse
# Note: NeRF requires TensorFlow 1.15 and CUDA, which may not be compatible with Apple Silicon
# Consider using modern NeRF implementations like nerfstudio for M-Series chips
